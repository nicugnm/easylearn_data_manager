When I writed code, I was careful to avoid
some [pitfalls](https://thorben-janssen.com/lombok-hibernate-how-to-avoid-common-pitfalls/):

- Donâ€™t Use @EqualsAndHashCode
- Be Careful with @ToString (Not use on @OneToMany and @ManyToOne)
- Avoid @Data
- Every Entity class should implement Serializable
